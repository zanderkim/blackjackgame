GAME: Blackjack (aka 21)

Blackjack is a popular card casino game - the most widely played casino banking game in the world. It uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as "twenty-one".

Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.

Fun fact: The first written mention of blackjack was in a collection of short stories by Miguel de Cervantes, the author of â€œDon Quixote," dating this game back to the late 16th/early 17th century.
